Hello all,

If you want to contribute to this project, please include descriptions of 
how you have created the contribution.

This project is for me to learn, so let us all teach each other.

Current needs are first of all the scene, which will contain asphalt,
a fence, brick walls and the basket with accompanying backboard.

An indoor court and audience is also needed.
